# fsNeighborhood
Developed a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood you would like to visit

### The project
It is a single map application of your neighborhood. I add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content (here is wiki).


### Screenshots

### Techniques
- Interacting with API servers like The Google Maps APIs
- Use of third-party libraries and APIs (mainly wiki)
- Asynchronous programming
- Use of Front-end framework, here is Knockout (a mini-framework like React)
